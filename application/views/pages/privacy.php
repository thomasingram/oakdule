	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>We take your privacy seriously. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve developed this simple Policy so that it&#8217;s easy for you to understand how we gather, store and use your personal information.</p>
	<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
	<p>Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our only purpose in gathering this information is to learn more about how you use Oakdule.</p>
	<p>We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (<abbr>IP</abbr>) addresses. We do not use such information to identify you, however, and will never disclose such information.</p>
	<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
	<p>Certain visitors to Oakdule choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. We gather information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us. We will never disclose personally-identifying information.</p>
	<p>At present we use Twitter as our identification provider. Any use of Twitter on behalf of the individual is subject to the <a href="http://twitter.com/tos">Twitter Terms of Service</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/privacy">Twitter Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
	<p>We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorised access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
	<h2>Protection of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
	<p>We will never rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. We will only disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information when required to do so by law.</p>
	<p>We have no access to information stored on your Twitter account beyond what is publicly available already and that which you have allowed us to gather for the purposes of creating your Oakdule account. We will never post to Twitter on your behalf.</p>
	<h2>Your habits</h2>
	<p>Your habit lists are private to you. We won&#8217;t share or publicise them.</p>
	<h2>Cookies</h2>
	<p>A <dfn>cookie</dfn> is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&#8217;s computer, and that the visitor&#8217;s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. We use cookies so that you don&#8217;t have to sign in each time you visit Oakdule. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computers then you should set your browsers to refuse cookies before using Oakdule.</p>
	<h2>Children&#8217;s Privacy</h2>
	<p>We will never knowingly collect or maintain information at our website from anyone under the age of 13.</p>
	<h2>Deleting Information</h2>
	<p>You can request the deletion of your entire Oakdule account, including all stored data, at any time by emailing <?php echo safe_mailto('contact@oakdule.com'); ?>. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before complying with your request.</p>
	<p>Due to the nature of backups and logs, deleted data may persist in backups and logs until they are deleted.</p>
	<h2>How To Contact Us</h2>
	<p>Should you have any questions or concerns about this Policy, please email <?php echo safe_mailto('contact@oakdule.com'); ?>. At this time, we only have the ability to receive and send English-language communications.</p>
	<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
	<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Oakdule website after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
